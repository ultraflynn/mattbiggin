  <h3>Contracting</h3>
  <div>
    I work in either the City of London or Canary Wharf. Full details of my previous contracts and roles can be found on my LinkedIn profile. The minimum contract length would be 6 months and I'm usually happy to sign up for longer. The more time I spend on a team the more I feel I can add because of the deeper understanding of the people and systems. Please contact me for daily rate and availability. Full business insurance through Atomicity Ltd.

  <h3>Freelance</h3>
  <div>
    Many developers go through there careers as a series of accidents, things just happening by themselves. That's just not the way to maximise your potential. I offer two services; firstly I can be available to provide direction to your career and learning. Secondly, I can help with interview preparation so you have the best chance of landing your dream job. Go guarantees, obviously, but the more preparation you put in, the better chance you will have. Drop me an email and we can talk about your future.
