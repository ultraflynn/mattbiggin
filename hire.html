  <h3>Freelance</h3>
  <div>
    <p>My preference is to work in my very well equiped home office in a small village outside Colchester. I'd rather spend time working on your problems than sitting in a train or a car.  If you'd like me to attend meetings and spend some time at your offices then that's fine as well. I'm happy to use all the tools available to ensure that communication is effective.</p>

    <p>I don't like working an hourly rate as I don't think anyone benefits, I will quote for particular project and if the scope isn't clear then I'll charge Â£500 a day until we've firmed up what is required.</p>

    <p>I'm delivery focused and that means that we will agree a deadline for the work. That's makes it clear to both parties when the work needs to be completed.</p>

    <p>I also like to agree a single point of contact with a client. Having multiple people providing input often leads to confusion, missed deadlines and unmet expectations.</p>
