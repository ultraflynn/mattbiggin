title: Some days are lego days
tags: [Coding, Lego]
synopsis: There are days as a developer when you work hard and get nowhere. You feel that you're going round in circles and getting nothing done. Then there are lego days. The days where each move is a step forward. Each decision a piece of the puzzle completed. Every line of a code a block of lego neatly slotted into place.

I'd like to introduce to a new term to the development community.

### The Lego Day

I love getting to the end of a day and declaring to myself with a smile that "That was a Lego Day!". It means that I've had a day where my efforts have moved things forward. Where each thing I've done has been worthwhile.

The alternative to a lego day is a day where nothing works. Where you can't seem to join the dots. Where you fail to make any progress.

I often wonder at the end of a day why that day went as it did. Difficult to tell sometimes. Perhaps it's what I'm trying to achieve that day. There is a vast difference between writing some unit tests and trying to implement new features into some legacy code.
