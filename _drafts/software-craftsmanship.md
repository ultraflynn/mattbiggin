title: What Software Craftsmanship means to me
tags: [Software Craftsmanship]
synopsis: There is a lot of misunderstanding about what software craftsmanship actually is. Is it TDD? Pair programming? Continuous integration? Agile methodology? Or something else. I'd like to explain why I think it's fundamentally none of these and what it means to me.
