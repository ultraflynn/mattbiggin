title: Introducing JMX into your application
tags: [JMX, Java]
synopsis: 2013-12-18-introducing-jmx.jpg
excerpt: I recently had to put some monitoring into an application and decided to look at using JMX for the first time. JMX has been around a long time and is a mature technology. How hard can it be?

Nothing full-blown, the scope here is "I want to monitor a application using JMX and perhaps change a few values".

Need to address doing this inside Spring and outside.
